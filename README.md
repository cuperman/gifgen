# GifGen

Gif generator service

## Deploy

Deploy the infrastructure to your AWS account with CDK

```bash
npx aws-cdk deploy --app "npx @cuperman/gifgen-infrastructure" GifGen
```

Deploy with observability

```bash
npx aws-cdk deploy --app "npx @cuperman/gifgen-infrastructure" GifGen --context observe
```

## Use

When the deployment is complete, it will output the rest api endpoint, which can be used to generate gif files

```bash
 âœ…  GifGen

Outputs:
GifGen.RestApiEndpoint1234567A = https://ab01c2def3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
```

Use this to create gif URLs, like:

`https://ab01c2def3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/random/success.gif`

Supported endpoints:

* `/random/{tag}.gif`
* `/search/{term}.gif`
* `/translate/{term}.gif`
* `/trending.gif`
